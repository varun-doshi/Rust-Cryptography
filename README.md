# Cryptography using Rust

## Work in Progress

### This repo contains implementations of cryptographic functions using Rust.

##### Note: Currently, not focused on creating the cryptographic functions themselves, but on understanding how these work. In due course, may contain creating the functions froms scratch

## Content

* [BLS Signature Verification](./src/bls.rs) <br />
* [BLS Signature Aggregation](./src/bls_aggregation.rs) <br />

## Contribution

If you would like to add some functions, feel free to clone,add and raise a PR. This repository is open for contributions.
